jQuery responsive google maps
=============================

What's it all about?
--------------------

Well, when scrolling a website on your mobile device you can get trapped in a google map 
due to the Maps scrollbar of deathâ„¢. This plugin gives you a native google maps on your 
website and a safe fallback to the static image API of google maps for smaller devices.

How to use?
-----------

Download the jquery.mobilegmap.js. Removing comments and minifying it will get you bonus points!

To use it:

``` javascript
$(document).ready(function(){

  // your google map container
  $('.gmap').mobileGmap();

})
```

You can optionally change these default parameters:

``` javascript
$(document).ready(function(){

  // your google map container
  $('.gmap').mobileGmap({
    deviceWidth: 480 // The select will be added for screensizes smaller than this
  });

})
```
If you want to pass the address, zoom level and the maptype you can use HTML5 data-attributes

``` html
  <div class="gmap" id="map" data-center="Brugse Heirweg 37 Aartrijke Belgium" data-zoom="15">
    <address>
      <strong>builtbyrobot</strong><br />
      Brugse Heirweg 37<br />
      8211 Aartrijke
    </address>
  </div>
```
And that's it that's all.

However...
----------

There are still some things that need to be taken care of:

*  make it optional to show / hide the address marker
*  add multiple markers with balloons containing more info / fallback with numbers or letters for the mobile version
